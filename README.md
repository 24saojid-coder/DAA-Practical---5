Aim: Implement Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the length and LCS for DNA sequences.
TASK-1: Find the similarity between the given X and Y sequence.
X=AGCCCTAAGGGCTACCTAGCTT
Y= GACAGCCTACAAGCGTTAGCTTG

TASK-2: Find the longest repeating subsequence (LRS). Consider it as a variation of the
longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.
Let the given string be S. You need to find the LRS within S. To use the LCS framework, you
effectively compare S with itself. So, consider string1 = S and string2 = S.
Example:
AABCBDC
LRS= ABC or ABD
